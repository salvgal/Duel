Duel game simulator - Test Driven Development - 3 out 4 test pass / 1 test ignored.




# if you are taking the exam

 1. Please read __every__ single line of comment, this exercise has been run hundreds of time. there might still be an error but it's very very unlikely.
 2. Difficulty is increasing, solve test one by one, __we want to see your method__ not the overall solution magically jump out of the hat.
 3. Do commit & push each time a new test becomes green.
 4. Keep in mind that this is a session to asses your coding skills : __how you are doing stuff__ is as important as passing all the tests.

You're not allowed to change a single character of the tests

Good luck :D
